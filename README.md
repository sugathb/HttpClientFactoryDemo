# Music Brainz Microservice

## Task

Create a http api application when supplied with the artist name will search the MusicBrainz.org service and return a response, the return pay load should be a collection of possible artist matches if there is more than one possible match, or a collection of all the releases for an artist if there is a single artist with that name.
Here is the api reference - https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/
